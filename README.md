# Ritz-Carlton Navigation & Slider Clone

This project is a **React-based recreation** of two key sections from the [Ritz-Carlton](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/) website:

- **Top Navigation Menu**
- **Homepage Slider/Carousel Section**
  - **I implemented both**:
    - **Custom React Slider** â€” built manually using state, refs, and animation logic
    - **SwiperJS** â€” used for fully responsive, smooth carousels

Built with modern frontend tools like **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **SwiperJS**, this project emphasizes responsive layout, semantic HTML, animation, and modular component architecture.
